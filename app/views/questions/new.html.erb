<h1>New Question</h1>
<%# form_for is a built-in rails helper that enables us to generate a form from
    an activerecord model to submit to the associated controller. if you pass in
    a non-persisted ActiveRecord object (not in the dB yet) then `form_for` will
    automatically assume that this form will submit to the `create` action in
    the associated controller ( in our case questions#create ) which has a PATH
    helper of `questions_path` so we must have `questions_path` defined

<%= @question.errors.full_messages.join(', ') %>

<%= form_for @question do |f| %>
  <div>
    <%= f.label :title %>
    <%= f.text_field :title %>
  </div>
  <div>
    <%= f.label :body %>
    <%= f.text_area :body %>
  </div>
  <%= f.submit %>
<% end %>
